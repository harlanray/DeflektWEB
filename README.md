<h1 align="center">Main Homepage | LANDING SITE</h1>

This is the start of a website built around a recording label started from a bedroom. It was never inteded to be a full-fledged company or business. It was created to allow myself, as an artist to get my mind off of trying to "make it," so I could focus solely on the craft, content and art of it all.

Initially appeared on [GitHub (repo)](https://github.com/harlanray/DeflektWEB).
